# Causal Analysis of Member Switching in German Health Insurance

This repository contains the code, data pipeline, and results for the study **"Causal Analysis of Member Switching in German Health Insurance"**, which combines predictive modeling and causal inference to understand how additional contributions (Zusatzbeitr√§ge) affect member churn in Germany‚Äôs statutory health insurance (SHI) system from 2016 to 2025.

## üìå Overview

This project investigates how changes in contribution rates affect member switching behavior using both Random Forest (prediction) and DoWhy (causal inference).

### Research Questions:
- **RQ1:** What is the causal impact of a fund‚Äôs additional contribution increase on its own churn rate?
- **RQ2:** How do competitor contribution rates influence switching?
- **RQ3:** How do causal inference methods compare to predictive models in explaining churn?

## üìä Methods

### üîç Predictive Modeling
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Features:**
  - Fund‚Äôs own contribution rate (`avg_zusatzbeitrag`)
  - Competitor rates
  - Market share (`marktanteil_mitglieder`)
  - Risk adjustment factor (`risikofaktor`)
  - Encoded fund name and survey responses
- **Output:** Binary classification (Churn: Yes/No)
- **Performance:** ~81% accuracy

### üß† Causal Inference (DoWhy)
- **Model A:** Effect of a fund‚Äôs own contribution increase
- **Model B:** Effect of competitors‚Äô contribution rate
- **Method:** Backdoor adjustment using causal graphs
- **Validation:** Placebo and refutation tests for robustness

---

## üìà Results

- **Predictive model** showed that market share and fund identity are strong churn predictors.
- **Causal analysis** revealed:
  - A statistically significant increase in churn after a fund raised its own rate.
  - Competitor rates also influence switching behavior.

---

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Predictive models explain **who** is likely to churn.
- Causal models explain **why** members churn ‚Äî especially in response to pricing.
- Causal methods provide policy-relevant insights, especially in regulated markets.
